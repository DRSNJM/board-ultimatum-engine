# Board Ultimatum

This library is a board game recommendation engine. It is best used with [the
noir app we created to use it](https://github.com/DRSNJM/board-ultimatum).

## Usage

To use this library it's you'll need to do three things:

1.  Set up its persistent store.
2.  Load in some data into the store.
3.  Use the library and figure out what board game to get off the shelf!
